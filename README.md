# Speedometer – How Fast I Am?

## What is this?

Summarized, "Speedometer – How Fast I Am?" is a small app that shows your current speed in different units (mph, km/h, m/s and kn).

Additionally, your current position on the globe is displayed by using the geographic coordinate system. To avoid speed tickets while using this app, a speed limit warning is also included. Tap the button to set your current speed as your current speed limit. Exceed it and the app will turn to a red color scheme.

## Why did you do this?

I started iOS development in summer of 2017. This app was intended as a small "playground" project to go through the whole lifecyle of an app: build, release, run, repeat. App Store Connect (former: iTunes Connect) was new to me and I just wanted to gain experiences with an example project.

Then I reached a point when I thought: "I should release this". There were not that much plain simple (and cost-free) speedometer apps available, so now there is one.

## Where do I find this?

Download the app for free [from the App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/speedometer-how-fast-i-am/id1361655713?ls=1&mt=8). It is localized in English and German (my native language).
